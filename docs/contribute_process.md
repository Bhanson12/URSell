# Contributing to Github

Here are some (proposed) standards we should maintain while using Github.
If you ever are unsure of what to do or how to do something, please just ask.

1. The `master` branch will always be functional. Do not modify this branch unless you are sure it will not break it.

2. For any new features, bug fixes, etc. please open a new branch (one per feature/bug/etc.).
Here is the process for contributing:

    1. Create a new branch with a meaningful name (like `log_in` or `fix_add_post`)
    2. Add commits to the branch as necessary (i.e. "save" when done minor changes)
    3. When the new feature is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) to merge it back on the `master` branch.
    4. Have at least one other group member review the changes and test them. This group member will comment that they've done so.
    5. Merge the PR. If there are merge conflicts and you don't know how to resolve them, leave a comment and we'll look at them together as a group.

Again, these standards are just a suggestion to maintain and add to our code cleanly and orderly. If there's any process you guys don't like or think it's unnecessary, bring it up and the group can talk about it.
